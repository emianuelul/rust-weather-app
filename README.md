# Rust Weather App

Project done for Uni, for the final grade. 

Built this app in about a week and a half, in Rust. Used Slint for the GUI, might not be my absolute best but it works.

## What I learned
- solidified my knowledge of how to code in Rust
- got a decent grip on how to use threads, mutexes and async functions in Rust
- learned how to use Slint to a decent level
- solidified my knowledge of how to parse json files and json objects
